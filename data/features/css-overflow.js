/**
 * TODO: initially implement CSS overflow property
 * Originally a single property for controlling overflowing content in both horizontal & vertical directions, the `overflow` property is now a shorthand for `overflow-x` & `overflow-y`. The latest version of the specification also introduces the `clip` value that blocks programmatic scrolling.
 * @see https://caniuse.com/css-overflow
