/**
 * TODO: initially implement CSS justify-content: space-evenly
 * The "space-evenly" value for the `justify-content` property distributes the space between items evenly. It is similar to space-around but provides equal instead of half-sized space on the edges. Can be used in both CSS flexbox & grid.
