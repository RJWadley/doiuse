/*

This file contains tests for :focus-visible CSS pseudo-class
The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class applies while an element matches the `:focus` pseudo-class, and the UA determines via heuristics that the focus should be specially indicated on the element (typically via a “focus ring”).

See: https://caniuse.com/css-focus-visible
