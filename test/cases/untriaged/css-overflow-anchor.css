/*

This file contains tests for CSS overflow-anchor (Scroll Anchoring)
Changes in DOM elements above the visible region of a scrolling box can result in the page moving while the user is in the middle of consuming the content.
By default, the value of  `overflow-anchor` is `auto`, it can mitigate this jarring user experience by keeping track of the position of an anchor node and adjusting the scroll offset accordingly

See: https://caniuse.com/css-overflow-anchor
