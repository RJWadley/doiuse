/*

This file contains tests for CSS -webkit-user-drag property
The non-standard `-webkit-user-drag` CSS property can be used to either make an element draggable or explicitly non-draggable (like links and images). See the standardized [draggable attribute/property](/mdn-api_htmlelement_draggable) for the recommended alternative method of accomplishing the same functionality.

See: https://caniuse.com/webkit-user-drag
